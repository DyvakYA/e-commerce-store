### Introduction
Design patterns are formalized bes practices that the programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system. 

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

### Getting started
If you want provide some manual testing welcome 
[https://dyvak-e-commerce-store.herokuapp.com/](https://dyvak-e-commerce-store.herokuapp.com/)

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
Programming/Software Design Principles.
 
Please lead KISS, YAGNI, SOLID and DRY principles. This direction will make your code better.

**What youâ€™ll need**
 
 * A favorite text editor or IDE
 * JDK 1.8 or later
 * Tomcat
 * Maven 

### Warning
 
Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.
 
Using design patterns in inappropriate places for this can lead to a violation of the principles of the OOP,
code readability and application malfunction.
  
The number of bugs may increase and the code will cease to be supported.
